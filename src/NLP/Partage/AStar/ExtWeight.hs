-- Traversal
--------------------------------------------------


-- | Traversal represents an action of inducing a new item on the
-- basis of one or two other chart items.  It can be seen as an
-- application of one of the inference rules specifying the parsing
-- algorithm.
--
-- TODO: Sometimes there is no need to store all the arguments of the
-- inference rules, it seems.  From one of the arguments the other
-- one could be derived.
--
-- TODO: Weight component can be extracted outside the Trav datatype.
